# Bioluminescent Biofoundry: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World

## Overview
This project proposes a Genetic Engineering BioFoundry on the ocean floor, utilizing bioluminescent organisms 
to produce bio-engineered materials, medicines, and bioplastics. The concept leverages the natural glow of these 
organisms as a real-time monitoring tool for metabolic processes.

### Key Features
- Bioluminescence as a Feedback Mechanism: Natural light emitted by engineered fungi/bacteria acts as a visual marker for metabolic processes.
- Marine Ecosystem Utilization: Tapping into underutilized ocean spaces reduces the need for land-based factories.
- IoT-Based Real-Time Monitoring: Sensors and IoT devices collect data on ecosystem health and production efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Genetic Engineering (CRISPR, Synthetic Biology)**: Used to create bioluminescent organisms tailored to marine environments.
- **IoT and Environmental Sensors**: Monitors temperature, pH, and salinity for real-time ecosystem management.
- **Cloud-Based Monitoring**: Remote access to real-time data through cloud systems.

## Code Overview
This repository contains Python scripts that simulate the IoT sensor data collection and monitoring of bioluminescence. 
These scripts demonstrate the integration of data collection in a marine biofoundry environment.

## How to Run the Simulations
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bioluminescent-biofoundry.git
```
2. Navigate to the `src` directory and run the simulation:
```
python data_simulation.py
python bioluminescence_monitor.py
```

## Future Plans
- Scale the simulation to a modular system with multiple biofoundry units.
- Incorporate AI-driven analysis of sensor data.
- Study the ecological impact of large-scale biofoundries.
